        <h1> Concept of Git</h1>
            <p> Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. 
                it is used for coordinating work among several people on a project and tracking progress overtime.
            </p>
            <p>Git is a widely used version control system (VSC) that lets you track of all the modifications you make to your code.
                Git is a distributed VCS, this means that every collaborator of the project will have a history of the changes made on their local machine.
            </p>
                <h2>GitHub</h2>
                    <p>Github on the other is a widely used platform for version control that used Git at its core. 
                        It lets you host the remote version of your project from where all the collaborators can have access to it.
                        Not just your own team member,but any member of Github can contribute to your code(that is if you choose to accept the changes made).
                        Github is like a social platform where you can find a plethora of open-source projects with their codes.
                        All the new and emerging technologies can be found on this platform <a href="http">Github.com</a>
                    </p>

                                <li>
                                   <strong>Repository:</strong> Repo is a folder ths contain all the project files that the history of the versions made to each.
                                            <p>There are two repositories of your project that you will work throughout the lifetime of your project.
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>
                                                       <strong>Remote repo:-</strong> Its contains your project that can be accessed from anywhere and by anyone.
                                                        this is the remote repository live on github and anybody can access it.
                                                     </li>
                                                     <li>
                                                         <strong>Local Repo:-</strong> This is a copy of the remote repo that resides on your local machine. 
                                                         All the changes you make will be savedin your local repo. Fellow developers will not be able to see them 
                                                         yet untill it is push to the remote repo.
                                                     </li>
                                                </ol>
                                            </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Cloning:</strong> means creating a copy of the remote repo on your local machine. Now you can make changes to the project on your local machine.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <h2>Beginner Step to using Git command prompt</h2>
                                    <ol>
                                        <strong>Step 1</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        <li> Make sure terminal has right project directory</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 2</strong> 
                                        <li> Initialise a repository using <strong>git init</strong> command</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 3</strong>
                                        <li>Configure Git: Make git know who make the changes by using <strong>git config</strong> command</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 4</strong>
                                        <li>Add file to project directory using <strong>git add <file-name></strong>
                                             <em>Adding files are in a place called staging</em>
                                             <p><strong>Staging area</strong> is an intermediate place between working directory and local git repo
                                            where any changes that are made can be reviewed before actually been commited them to the repo.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 4</strong>
                                        <li>After the staging area, take a snapshot of all the changes made, which are reflected in the staging area, 
                                            and save them in the Git repo using <strong>git command -m 'commit message'</strong>
                                            <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The whole point of version control is to keep a record of the changes that were made. 
                                                Do this using the <strong>git log command</strong> it gives a complete view of all the commits that were made in reverse chronological order.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 5</strong>
                                        <li>Create a new branch. Branch allow to move back and forth between 'states' of a project.
                                            when one create a new branch, git keep track of which commit the branch "branched off of", so it knows the history behind all the files.
                                            <p>Let's says you are on the master branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. <strong>Run: git checkout -b <my branch name></strong>
                                                This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it i .e git will move you to that branch, off of the master branch.
                                            </p>
                                            <Span>Use 'git branch' command to confirm that yout branch was created</Span>
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 6</strong>
                                        <li>
                                            Create a new repository on Github: This require your log in and creating a new repo on github home page.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Step 7</strong>
                                        <li>
                                            Push a branch to Github: Push the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo. Tis allows other people to see the changes you've made.
                                            This is done by using the command key <strong>git push -u origin yourbranchname</strong>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                            </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <span> Other commands include the git pull, git merge including advanced git attribute.</span>
                                        </p>

                                           <h3>Cloning a Github repository</h3>
                                           <p>
                                               We can create our own local repo and push it to Github. if you aren't the on that created the repo.One would have to make a copy on local machine.
                                               Once a project has been uploaded onto the remote repository,developers can get their own copy of this repo using the <strong>git clone</strong> command.
                                               To clone to local machine,go to terminal and provide the URL in the following command <strong> git clone <span>URL</span>  </strong>
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                               Branching and merging: Branches let you work on new features or bug fixes of the main project code that is presenton the master branch.
                                               <br>
                                               <Strong>
                                                   Do not pull directly to the master branch (main project branch) especially when working with group of dev.
                                               </Strong>
                                               Branches let you experiment with new features or idea and even let you create a new branches in parallel to experiment with different features.
                                               Create new branch using <strong>git branch</strong>
                                           </p>
                                           <p>Once confident that the code is working well, integrate it with master branch using the <strong>git merge command</strong>
                                                <br>
                                                To merge to master when sure there is no more bugs:
                                                <strong>git merge branch name -m "messages"</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Pull using Git: 
                                            <br>
                                            Pull: Lets you fetch any updates from the remote repo and merge it with the local repo, using pull command
                                            <span>git pull orgin branch-name</span>
                                        </p>
